name: clean-comments
description: Use when writing, fixing, editing, or reviewing code comments. Enforces Clean Code principles—no metadata, no redundancy, no commented-out code.
when_to_use: |
  Also trigger on: commented-out code blocks, TODO/FIXME banners, author/ticket/date metadata in comments, documentation that no longer matches the code, redundant comments that restate the code (e.g. `i += 1  // increment i`), or asks like "is this comment useful", "why is this block commented".

# Clean Comments

## C1: No Inappropriate Information

Comments shouldn't hold metadata. Use version control for author names, change history,
ticket numbers, and dates. Comments are for technical notes about code only.

## C2: Delete Obsolete Comments

If a comment describes code that no longer exists or works differently,
delete it immediately. Stale comments become "floating islands of
irrelevance and misdirection."

## C3: No Redundant Comments

```
// Bad — the code already says this
i += 1  // increment i
save(user)  // save the user

// Good — explains WHY, not WHAT
i += 1  // offset for zero-indexed display
```

## C4: Write Comments Well

If a comment is worth writing, write it well:
- Choose words carefully
- Use correct grammar
- Don't ramble or state the obvious
- Be brief

## C5: Never Commit Commented-Out Code

```
// DELETE THIS
// function calculateTax(income) {
//   return income * 0.15
// }
```

Who knows how old it is? Who knows if it's meaningful? Delete it.
Version control remembers everything.

## The Goal

The best comment is the code itself. If you need a comment to explain
what code does, refactor first, comment last.
